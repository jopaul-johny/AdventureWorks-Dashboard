# AdventureWorks-Dashboard
This project involves using the readily available AdventureWorks dataset for an anlysis in Power BI.

All the data cleaning and transformation of data has been done within Power BI.
Relationships were established between tables using Model View of power Bi.
Custom measures were introduces instead of calculated columns whenever possible inorder to reduce to load. All the Measures used in this analysis were grouped together into a single table.

The visualization is done using maximum possible tools such as Parameters, Bookmarks, Custom Tooltips etc, while keeping the dashboard and reports uncluttered.
